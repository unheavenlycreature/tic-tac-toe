# Tic-Tac-Toe

A command-line version of Tic-Tac-Toe that two players can play together.

Brainstorming how this should probably be implemented.
-- Player is an object.
---- Has a name, has a symbol that they use.
-- Board is an object.
---- Board knows how to print itself
---- Player has a symbol that they're using (X or O)
---- Game manager mediates between the players and knows whose turn it is
------- Can also decide who goes first.
------- Knows how many turns are in the game.
